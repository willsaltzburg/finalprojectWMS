# finalprojectWMS

Hello and welcome to my final project for GOVT-470: Intro to Applied Political Data Science, an undergraduate course at American University in Washington D.C.

For my project, I use the tools we learned in class to explore patterns in gun violence deaths in the United States from 2012 to 2018, the most recent years with reliable data.
