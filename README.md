# finalprojectWMS

Hello and welcome to my final project for GOVT-470: Intro to Applied Political Data Science, an undergraduate course at American University in Washington D.C.

For my project, I use the tools we learned in class to explore patterns in gun violence deaths in the United States from 2012 to 2018, the most recent years with reliable data.

This github repository holds the data set I used in my analysis (guns.csv), the large parsing function I used to clean and merge the data, the .Rmd file used to compile my paper, and the PDF version of the paper. I look forward to hearing your feedback!
